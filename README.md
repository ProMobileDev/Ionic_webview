# Pttr Mobile App

Pttr's Mobile App allows users to view stray animals in shelters nearby their current location, as well as provide donations to such nearby shelters and adopt/like animals.


## Development Environment

Make sure to run `ionic platform add <platformName>` after a fresh clone of the repo. This allows the app to be executed in the platform of your choice, whether that be Android or iOS. Pre-configured hooks will then install Cordova plugins that we need into the app.

There are pre-set hooks that allow you to install cordova plugins to extend the app's functionality.

To run gulp, make sure to execute `gulp` on the terminal.
